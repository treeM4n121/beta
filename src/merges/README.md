## Platform specific resources

Each platform (**Web**, **Cordova**, **Electron**) can have specific resources for the build. To do so:

*  put the resource you want for a specific platform in the right folder,
*  run the build for the target you want, example: `npm run electron`,
*  then your resource will be added in the build.
