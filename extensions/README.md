## System Designer Extensions

You can extend System Designer by adding extensions at runtime.

You will find in the system `extensions.json` a list of systems that you import in System Designer to add new features (see [this documentation](https://designfirst.io/systemdesigner/documentation/docs/en/manage-extensions.html) for more information on this subject).
